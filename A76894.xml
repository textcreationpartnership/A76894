            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>ON the 12 of this in≈øtant March, we di≈øcovered a Fleet of ≈øhips coa≈øting along the Channel, who≈øe pride and in≈øolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, did much exa≈øperate the ≈øpirits of our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117995:3"/>Officers and Souldiers, who making towards them, found them to be Hollanders; whereupon Captain John≈øon haled to them, demanding from whence they came, and where bound: the Dutch Captains an≈øwer'd, That they ≈øcorn'd to give an account to Engli≈øh-men. Then Captain John≈øon required them to ≈øtrike ≈øayl in obedience and honour to the States of England; but that ≈øeemed more dete≈øtable unto them; who ≈øaid, That although they never cut off a Kings Head, yet they were the anciente≈øt States: Why then have at you, reply'd Capt. John≈øon, I'le have ≈øome of your heads before I leave you; and withall, gave them a broad ≈øide, &amp; immediatly tackt about and gave them another, which did great exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution both above and below Decks: The Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being exceedingly inraged thereat, gave him a gallant Volley of 7 broad ≈øides; but were an≈øwer'd treble by the re≈øt of the Engli≈øh ≈øhips; who by that time were come up clo≈øe to engage; in≈øomuch that a ≈øharp and bloudy fight began, which continued for the ≈øpace of 3 hours; being performed with great gallantry on both ≈øides: But at la≈øt Captain Stokes coming in, did ≈øo terrifie them with round ≈øhot, and Hand-Granadoes, that he ≈øoon fired one, ≈øunk ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and boarded a third; which the re≈øt of the Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins perceiving, declined engagement, and with a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117995:3"/>fre≈øh Gale ≈øailed towards the Coa≈øt of France. We had them in cha≈øe for the ≈øpace of 5 hours, but night approaching, we were inforced to de≈øi≈øt. The≈øe are ≈øaid to be New-Commi≈ø≈øion Pyrats, ≈øet forth with Letters of Mart from the Scotch-King, and not by the Authority of the States of Holland. Their lo≈ø≈øe we conceive to be very great; for each ≈øhip that were ≈øunk, carryed 34 pieces of Ordnance, &amp; man'd with 80 men, ≈øtout knaves I'le a≈ø≈øure you. In this conflict we lo≈øt about 27 men; the Enemy neer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two hundred.</p>
               <p>The Hollander hath ≈øet forth a Declaration to rai≈øe 60000 Hor≈øe and Foot; and 300 Sayl of ≈øhips; but their de≈øign is variou≈øly ≈øpoken of.</p>
               <p>Yet great are the Conte≈øts between the Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma≈øters and the Bores; for the latter doth threaten to ≈øeque≈øter their E≈øtates, and bring them to a Tryall for their lives, if they will not take a cour≈øe to defend and a≈ø≈øi≈øt them at Sea.

               <p>THere hath been a great and imperial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel held at Mun≈øter in Germany, by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øadors of 13 Chri≈øtian Kings, Princes, and Dukes; At which Diet, they took into con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the pre≈øent ≈øtate and condition of many exiled Princes; and among≈øt the re≈øt, a Conference aro≈øe touching the King of Scots; but nothing dne therein (at pre≈øent) by rea≈øon of other weighty and emergent bu≈øine≈ø≈øes, which call them to a Work of far greater concernment; and may al≈øo prove fatal, if not timely prevented: For the Great Turk, and his Ba≈øhaw have taken the field with ≈øeven hundred thou≈øand Hor≈øe and Foot, and are re≈øolved (if po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to make a great deva≈øtation and inroad upon Chri≈øtendom this Summer: But great is the care of the Emperour of Germany, the 7 Chri≈øtian Princes of Italy, the Queen of Sweden, the Prince of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øilvania, and Prince Frederick of Malta, to rai≈øe a formidable Power, and to unite and joyn with the Venetians, both in an offen≈øive and defen≈øive War again≈øt the Turks; And in pur≈øuance thereof, a League is concluding between the afore≈øaid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; who have had a large con≈øultation thereupon; But that which is thought mo≈øt requi≈øite and fea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at pre≈øent, is, the ≈øending of a Summons to all Chri≈øtendom, for Warlike Provi≈øions to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117995:4"/>the Enemies thereof; And indeed great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon have they ≈øo to do; for never was a more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and irre≈øi≈øtable Army rai≈øed the≈øe many years, as now the Turks and Jani≈øaries have rai≈øed. Yet notwith≈øtanding, Prince Philip (the third Son to the Queen of Bohemia, and General to the Stases of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice) hath given them a great Overthrow neer the I≈øle of Candia, and kill'd, taken, and routed about three≈øcore thou≈øand men: This Overthrow doth exceedingly retard the Enemies De≈øign; and as it is a great prejudice to them, ≈øo it is a great advantage to Chri≈øtendom; And his Highne≈ø≈øe Prince Philip hath embraced this opportunity; who by the a≈ø≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Divine Power, hath obtained another great Victory again≈øt the Jani≈øaries: Since which Atchievements, he is called Philip the Great; a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a gallant temper, and endow'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Properties and Vertues, both for prudence, wi≈ødom, and magnanimity of Spirit: He is even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as great a Terrour to the Turks, as Alexander the Great was to the Chri≈øtians.</p>
               <p>The King of Scots hath ≈øent the Lord Wilmot with a Me≈ø≈øage to the Princes of Italy, imploring Supplies and Accommodation, ≈øuitable to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Nece≈ø≈øities and Condition; but they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned An≈øwer, That by rea≈øon of the home-bred
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117995:5"/>divi≈øions, and forreign Preparations of the Enemy in ≈øeverall parts again≈øt the Chri≈øtian Territories; they could not an≈øwer his expectation at pre≈øent, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Malta hath declared, that he will give his Royal A≈ø≈øent to the Union, and that he will rai≈øe forty thou≈øand Hor≈øe and Foot, to joyn with the Chri≈øtians again≈øt the Turks; and in pur≈øuance thereof hath granted a Commi≈ø≈øion to Prince Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick, Landgrave of He≈ø≈øe, to command in chief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Highne≈øs Prince Philips.</p>
               <p>It is reported, that Lieu. Col. Lilburn is made captain of a Man of War for the States of Holland; and that he hath received Power and In≈øtructions, to fire, ≈øink, or take, any ≈øhips what≈øoever, that ≈øhall be declared Enemies to the United Provinces.</p>
               <p>Some al≈øo relate, that he hath ≈øent a Letter to the Lord General, puting his Exceliency in mind of his Prote≈øtation at Huntington; wherein he de≈øires him to ≈øtand up again≈øt Oppre≈ø≈øion; to propagate the Go≈øpel; to pre≈øerve the liberty of the People, and to maintain the Laws of the Land in its purity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corruption or bribery.</p>
